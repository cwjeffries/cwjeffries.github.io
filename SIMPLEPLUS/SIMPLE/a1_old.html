          <b> Bath bombs, they are all over the web from people showing them off on Youtube or being shared on Facebook when a cool style gets made. 
           <br />
           If you have not heard of them then to put it simply they are generally small balls that fizz and disolve when placed in water, which leaves some bubbles and a nice color. </b>

			<br />
			
			<ol> 
			<li> 2 oz. of baking soda || <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1/159-1973270-9392268?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=baking+soda" target="_blank"> purchase </a> </li>

			<li> 1/2 teaspoon of water </li>
			
			<li> 1/2 teaspoon of essential oil (although you can use more and various kinds to mix up your bath bombs) || <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_1_4?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=essential+oils&sprefix=esse%2Caps%2C189&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Aessential+oils" target="_blank"> purchase </a> </li>

                       <pre>Now lettuce get to actually using all this stuff, it's not too hard if you follow these easy steps!</pre>
                       <br />
                       
                       <ol>
                            <li> Grab a sizeable bowl or something else that you can put a cover over. Pour the dry ingredients, those are 1-4 listed above, into whatever container you grabbed and then cover the top before shaking forcefully for 20 seconds then leave it to settle. </li>
                            <li> The next step is to get ingredients 5-8, the wet ingredients, and to mix them throughly together whether with a whisk or a liquid proof container until they appear to have combined. </li>
                            <li> Once you've got all your ingredients in their spots it's time to bring it together before you form them. Now that your dry ingredients have settled take the lid off and grab a whisk if you don't have one already then just start pouring in the wet ingredients making sure to whisk well to keep your new mixture from foaming and fizzing. </li>
                            <li> If your mix is throughly combined then it is time to test if will hold, get a small handful and just squeeze it together. It should hold similar to wet sand but a little stickier, if it falls apart too easily then just add a small amount of water and try again, and that's what we want for our molds! </li>
                            <li> Time to actually form our bath bombs into bath bombs. If you want smooth spheres you can use any half circle container that evenly takes your mix for the halves but make sure to really press it into the mold because if it's too loose it won't hold strong enough later on. So depending on what you are using you may want to get something hard that can really pack it in. If you have two halves don't forget to join them together.</li>
                         <li> The final step is to let it harden/set and that can be done a few ways. You can put it in the freezer for 20 minutes, this is a good option if you're looking to use it very soon such as the same night, or you can let it sit out for around 8 hours so that it air drys and hardens. </li>
                       </ol>

				   <h3>| Final Touches |</h3>
                   The only thing left to do is use the darn thing, so whether you want to do that yourself or give it to someone else in your house to use is up to you. If you were looking into this as a gift for a friend or significant other then get some nice plastic wrap and seal it up to keep it together or from rubbing off anywhere. But there you have it, a nice little ball of fizz you can throw into your tub for an interesting bath full of bubbles and scents!
