        A Little About Me

        <div class="innerLeft">
          Well hello there friend, looking for something specific? If that is the case then go ahead and check out that little left sidebar to fly around this site of mine. I hope you enjoy it!
        </div>
        <div class="innerRight">
          But if you're here to learn about me then look no further. My name is Chase Jeffries and I currently attend Clarion University studying Computer Science, and I am in my sophomore year as of this current paragraph. 
        </div>
        <div class="innerLeftAlt">
          Well I am 19 years old which is pretty cool I suppose, an interesting fact that I know the hip kids will enjoy would be that I was born April 20th.
        </div>
        <div class="innerRightAlt">
          My plan for the future is nothing too much right now, I just want to get through college as well as I can and then use my skills aquired to work somewhere that I can hopefully enjoy; something related to computer science or web design would be rad.
